/*
    In order to make this dynamic calculator take in user input, I am going to use the prompt-sync package from the
    npm repo (see the how to use npm markdown file for instructions on how to get the package). So the first thing I
    am going to do for this application is set up the prompt function
*/

const prompt = require('prompt-sync')();    // make sure to add second set of open and close parenthesis

/*
    Now that we have a way of easily getting user input I can start thinking about how to keep my application
    runing until the user tells it to stop. In this case, I am going to use a while loop, because I don't know
    how long the user is going to want the application to keep running, and so the ease of creating a while loop
    will suit me better than a for loop would

    So, to start my pseudo-code, my application is going to start by looking somewhat like this:

    let booleanControllingLoop = true;
    while(booleanControllingLoop){
        calculator stuff will go in here
    }

    by creating a boolean variable that represents true, I can now control when I want my application to stop
    looping. All I need to do is provide some code that will change the value of the control variable to false.
    This is something that I will include after I set up the first action/operation of the calculator

    Speaking of which, let's start by simply providing a way of doing addition. I am going to let the user add
    two numbers together, so I will need to prompt the user for these numbers. Also, because I need to potentially
    reuse these numbers in my loop, I am going to declare them in the block of the loop
*/

/*
let myBoolean = true;
while(myBoolean){
    console.log("this will run until myBoolean is changed to false");
    myBoolean = false;
}
*/

// everyting should happen inside the loop now so the user can keep working on it

/*
let running = true;
    while(running){                                                  // parse means to read or conver
    let numberOne = prompt("Please enter the first number: ");      // don't forget to parse the number from this string input
    let numberTwo = prompt("Please enter the second number: ");     // don't forget the parse the number from this string input
    console.log(parseInt(numberOne) + parseInt(numberTwo));
    let again = prompt("Thanks for using the calculator! If you like to go again, please enter y: ");
    if(again !== "y"){
        running = false;
    }
}
console.log("Goodbye!");
*/

/*
    So now we have a calculator that can do addition on two numbers, let's add in the ability to do subtraction!
    In order to switch between addition and subtraction, we will need to have a third variable that represents
    the operation we want to perform

    while(running){
