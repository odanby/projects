/*
    This exercises  involves creating a mad lib that will generate the missing words via arrays you create. 
    For the sake of simplicity your mad lib should be no more than a paragraph or two, and you should aim to fill 
    in no more than 5 blanks in the story. Use only the following tools to make your static mad lib (application 
    runs once, does not take in user input):

    include these:
        variables
        if
        else if
        else
        console.log()
        for
        while
        do while
        arrays
        template literals

    Stretch Goals:
    write multiple mad libs that take in varying amounts of words 
    use your knowledge of control flow to determine which mad lib is printed to the console
*/

/*
    make sure to define your variables
*/

/*
// these are just for example: your mad lib may use more or fewer parts of speech
properNouns = [];
verbs = [];
adjectives = [];
adverbs = [];

madlib = 
`
    you can write your mad lib in a template literal. This allows you to make a multi-line string while also
    adding the contents of your arrays with the filler words. You can do this by writing a $ and then placing curly
    brackets after it. Inside of the curly brackets you would place the value you want inserted, like so: 
    ${properNouns[0]}. This is how you can easily fill in the blanks for your mad lib.

        Today I went to the zoo.

        I got some ${noun[2]} and fed them to a ${adjective[2]} ${adjective[3]} ${noun[3]}, towering above my head.
        The ${noun[3]} must've been at least ${number[0]} feet tall!
        "Want to be friends?" the ${adjective[2]} ${noun[3]} called out. I jumped back. They could...speak?
        "My name is ${properNoun[0]}! Pleasure to meet ya!" they said.
