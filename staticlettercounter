/*
    Using the control flow tools you have learned, write a script that will count how many vowels are in your
    name and print a message stating how many there are to the console. For instance, if I provide the name
    Eric I should get the message back saying something like "vowels in your name: 2". Use only the tools
    and skills you have learned in training to make your script (no googling how to get user input: everything
    should be handled by creating variables and manually changing them before you execute your script).

    Stretch goals:
    - count how many total words there are in the name (done!)
    - count how many consonants there are in the name (done!)
    - make it not count spaces for letter counter (done!)

/*
    Brainstorm section:

    I need a variable that represents the name I am looping through and a variable that represents the number
    of vowels in the name I am looping through.
*/

/* 
nameToLoopThrough = ""; //assign a value later
vowelCount = 0; // this value will increase depending on the name I loop through
*/

/*
    Now that I have my variables, I need to start thinking about what kind of code I need to write for this script
    to work correctly. I know that I need to loop through the name, so an easy way to do this is by using a for loop;

    for(let letter of nameToLoopThrough){

    }

    Inside of this loop, I know I need to check and see if each letter is a vowel or not

    for(let letter of nameToLoopThrough){
        if(letter is a vowel){

        }
    }

    If the letter is in fact a vowel, then I want to increase the vowelCount variable by 1

    for(let letter of nameToLoopThrough){
        if(letter is a vowel){
            vowelCount++
        }
    }

    After I have looped through all the letters of the name, I want to print a message to the console
    stating how many vowels there are.

    for(let letter of nameToLoopThrough){
        if(letter is a vowel){
            vowelCount++
        }
    }
    console.log(statement);
