     <!-- 
        Exercise One: set an attribute on the header element below that will create an alert on the screen saying
        "exercise one complete" when you click on it
      -->
    
      <h1 onclick = "alert('Exercise One Complete')">make a popup appear when you click on this element</h1>

     <!-- 
        Exercise Two: set an attribute on the header element below that will change the background color of this
        element to yellow when you click on it
      -->

      <h1 id = "yellowElement"; onclick = "this.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow'">
        make the background of this element turn yellow when you click on it
      </h1>

     <!-- 
        Exercise Three: create a function in the script section below that will add a solid red border to the header
        below. Make the function execute when the button below is pressed by assign an attribute to the button
      -->

      <h1 id = "redBorder">make this element gain a solid red border by clicking the button below</h1>
      <button onclick = "makeRedBorder()">make this button give the header above a solid red border</button>

     <!-- 
        Exercise Four: make the header element below change into a new color when you move the mouse over it,
        then revert to its previous color when you move the mouse off it by adding attributes to the element
      -->

      <h1 id = "colorChange"; onmouseover = "this.style.color = 'pink'"; onmouseleave = "this.style.color = 'black'">make this element text change color when you move the mouse over it/off it</h1>

</body>
<script>
    // now the third exercise
    
    function makeRedBorder(){
      redBorder.style.border = "solid";   // this worked because I used redBorder as the id that the function works with
      redBorder.style.borderColor = "red";
    }
</script>
