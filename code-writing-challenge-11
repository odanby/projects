    <!-- 
    The challenges in this file are designed to help you become more familiar with how to work with
    html, css, and JavaScript. For each challenge you will be given instructions for what you need to do to 
    complete the exercise. Note that all exercises in this file should be handled by writing code in the script
    section below
     -->

     <!-- 
        Exercise One: make the header element below have red text by writing code in the script section below
      -->
    
      <h1 id="exerciseOne">Make this text red by writing JavaScript in the script section below</h1>

     <!-- 
        Exercise Two: make the paragraph elements below all have green text below by grouping them together and
        then creating a loop to assign them the proper coloring. HINT: there are a few methods you could use that
        would group the elements together in a collection
      -->

      <p class="exerciseTwo">make the text of these paragraph elements green by writing JavaScript in the script section below</p>
      <p class="exerciseTwo">make the text of these paragraph elements green by writing JavaScript in the script section below</p>
      <p class="exerciseTwo">make the text of these paragraph elements green by writing JavaScript in the script section below</p>

     <!-- 
        Exercise Three: create an event listener on the button below that will make an alert appear when it is
        clicked that says "Exercise three completed." HINT: you will want to create a function that makes the call
        to the alert
      -->

      <button id="button">make this button cause a pop up to appear</button>

     <!-- 
        Exercise Four: create two event listeners for the header element below: one that changes the background
        color of the element when your mouse moves over it, another that remove the background color when you 
        move the mouse off of the element. HINT: create functions that add the styling to the element
      -->

      <h1 id="exerciseThree">make the background of this element change when the mouse moves over/off it by using event listeners</h1>

</body>
<script>
    // use this section to complete all the exercises

    const exerciseUno = document.getElementById("exerciseOne"); // i put different javascript variable names then html ids to note that they are two
    exerciseUno.style.color = "red";                            // different things

    // exercise two

    const exerciseDos = document.getElementsByClassName("exerciseTwo");
    for(let colorGreen of exerciseDos){
      colorGreen.style.color = "green";
    }

    // exercise three
    const popButton = document.getElementById("button");
    // popButton is my JS variable, button is my html id

    function buttonPopUp(){
      alert("Exercise Three completed!")
    };
    // buttonPopUp is my JS function, and I use alert("") to make alert pop up

    popButton.addEventListener("click", buttonPopUp); // this is me calling upon function when I click

    // exercise four

    const exerciseTres = document.getElementById("exerciseThree");

    function mouseMovesOver(){
      exerciseTres.style.backgroundColor = "blue"
    };

    function mouseMovesOff(){
      exerciseTres.style.backgroundColor = "white"
    };
