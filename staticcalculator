/* 
    For this exercise you need to create a static calculator using the tools
    you have learned so far. Some helpful tools will be:
    - if
    - else if
    - else
    - console.log();

    Don't forget to make variables, and aim to have your calculator, at a
    minimum, be able to do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

    Stretch Goals:
        - find the remainder of a division operation
        - raise a number to a given power
        - make sure the denominator of a division operator is not zero
            - print a message to the console reminding the user not to divide by zero if they try
*/

    Brainstorm section.
    I have 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
    I have + - x / = 

    If I have a number, I am going to figure out how to add to it, subtract from it, multiply, and divide
